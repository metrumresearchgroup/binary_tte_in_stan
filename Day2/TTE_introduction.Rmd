# What is time-to-event data?
  
  - In clinical studies, we often measure the time to a specific event:
    - time to death
    - time to disease worsening
    - time to incident adverse event
    - time to abnormal lab value (e.g., AST > 3xULN)
    - time to infection
    - time to study discontinuation
    - duration of hospital visit

# A little notation

* There are two time-to-event processes happening:

   * $T$ = time to event of interest
   * $C$ = time to censoring

* With right censoring, we observe 
    * $T^* = \text{min}(T,C)$
    * $\delta = I(T \leq C)$

* We are trying to estimate the distribution of T, but we observe T*

  * We'll return to this when discussing model diagnostics

* Typical to assume that $T$ and $C$ are independent (conditional on covariates in the model)
  


# Types of censoring

- Right censoring
  - We know the event did not happen prior to time $b$ (i.e., we know $T > b$)
- Left censoring
  - We know the event happened before time $a$ (i.e., we know $T < a$)
- Interval censoring
  - We know the event happened between times $a$ and $b$ but not the exact time (i.e, $a < T < b$) 

- In clinical trials, we most often deal with right and interval censoring


# How does censoring introduce complexity?

- If we observed event times for all subjects, we could use 'standard' methods

- Hard to estimate probability density function when we don't see all events happening
  - A type of missing data problem

- Working with the <red>hazard function</red> alleviates some of the problems

- Hazard function = instantaneous event rate, conditional on event happening on or after time $t$
  - $h(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{P(t < T \leq t+\Delta t ~|~  T \geq t )}{\Delta t}$
  - "conditional on event happening on or after time $t$" is what helps

# Developing some intuition about the hazard function

Imagine event times are  measured on a discrete scale (days).

Probability density/mass for having an event on day 366: $f(366) = P(T = 366)$
  
Probability of surviving longer than 365 days: $S(365) = P(T > 365)$
  
Probability of having an event on day 366 given survival through 365 days (this is the intuition of the hazard function): 

\begin{align}
h(t) &= P(T = 366|T>365) \\
&= P(T = 366 \text{ and } T > 365) ~/~ P(T > 365) \\
& \text{Note: T = 366 implies T>365, so the conditional can be simplified} \\
&= P(T = 366)/T(365) \\
h(365) &= f(366)/S(365) 
\end{align}

This is a discrete approximation;  a rigorous derivation uses limits and $\delta t$


# Terminology

- Hazard function:
  - $h(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{P(t < T \leq t+\Delta t ~|~  T \geq t )}{\Delta t}$
<br> 
- Cumulative hazard = total hazard accumulated to time $t$
  - $H(t) = \int_0^t h(s) ds$
  - This is the expected number of events to time $t$ [@noauthor_2011-gh]
<br>
- Probability density function = instantaneous event risk (aka *density*)
  - $f(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{P(t < T \leq t+\Delta t)}{\Delta t}$
<br>
- Survival function = probability of an event happening after time $t$
  - $S(t) = P(T > t)$

# Connections

Two important relationships to remember:

* The relation between the survival function and the cumulative hazard
$$
\begin{align*}
S(t) &= \exp\left\{-H(t)\right\}
\end{align*}
$$

* We can derive the density function from the hazard and survival functions
$$
\begin{align*}
f(t) &= h(t) S(t)
\end{align*}
$$

<!-- - importance of survival function -->
- When estimating S(t), we (almost) always assume censoring is independent of event time

# Workbook 01: Relationship between functions

Let's look at the relationship between the hazard, cumulative hazard, density, and survival functions for some parametric distributions.
  
  
#  Non-parametric estimation of survival, cumulative hazard and hazard functions

* We'll start with non-parametric estimates of $S(t)$ and $H(t)$
* The most commonly used estimator of $S(t)$ is the <red>Kaplan-Meier</red> estimator
  - aka the ***product limit*** estimate

* The most common estimator of $H(t)$ is the `Nelson-Aalen` estimator
  - Can also estimate $S(t)$ as $\widehat{S_{FH}(t)} = \exp\left\{ \widehat{H_{NA}(t)} \right\}$
  - This is known as the Fleming-Harrington estimate of $S(t)$
  - Similar, but not identical, to K-M estimate

# Basics of Kaplan-Meier estimate

Suppose we have these 10 event times (in days): 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
lung %>% 
  mutate(status=status-1) %>% 
  arrange(time,status) %>%
  filter(time > 80) %>% 
  select(time,status) %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  mutate(event_time = if_else(status==0, paste0(time,'+'), as.character(time))) %>% 
  pull(event_time)
```
where a "+" denotes a censored observation.

How would you estimate 

>- $P(T > 80)$ ?   
>    - $P(T>80) = 1$ because all event times are after 80 days


>- $P(T > 90)$?  
>    - $P(T > 90) = 6/10$ because we know exactly 4 events happened before 90 days

>- $P(T > 94)$?
>    - $P(T > 94) = ?$  We know 3 events happened after 94 days, but what about the censored time at 92 days?


# Kaplan-Meier and conditional probability

It turns outs that we can use some basic probability calculations to estimate $S(t)$ in the presence of censoring.  

1. Divide time into distinct intervals (at each event time, $\tau_j$)    
2. For each interval $j$,    
    - Calculate the proportion of subjects with an event ($d_j$), among the subjects in the risk set for that interval ($r_j$)  
    - The <grn>risk set</grn> at time $t$ = N - # events prior to $t$ - # censored prior to $t$  
    - Calculate the probability of an event after the $j^{th}$ interval, conditional on no event prior to the interval as $1 - \frac{d_j}{r_j}$

3. Estimate $S(t)$ as the product of the conditional probabilities up to time $t$
    - $\hat{S}_{KM}(t) = \prod_{\tau_j \leq t} 1 - \frac{d_j}{r_j}$

# Kaplan-Meier estimation in R

Fortunately, we don't have to do that work by hand :)

The `survfit` function in the R package `survival` does the work for us:

:::{.center}
```{r}
fit0 <- survfit(Surv(TTE,AE_any) ~ 1, data=dat_use)
```
:::

- The `Surv(time, event)` function creates a survival response object
    - `time` = event or censoring time
    - `event` = event indicator (1=event, 0 = right censored)
    - More complex types of censoring can be handled

- RHS of formula cannot include continuous variables (*Why?*)
    - This is okay: `survfit(Surv(TTE, AE_any) ~ Quartile, data=dat_use)`
    - This is not: `survfit(Surv(TTE, AE_any) ~ CAVGSS, data=dat_use)`

# Basic Survfit output

The `survfit` object gives us some basic information:

```{r}
print(fit0)
```

# More Survfit output

We can get more detail and predicted values with `summmary`

```{r}
summary(fit0, times = seq(0,1,by=0.25))
```

We'll explore more in the hands-on section.


# Plotting the estimated survival function

The `survminer::ggsurvplot` function provides clean plots

```{r}
survminer::ggsurvplot(fit0, risk.table = TRUE)
```


# Workbook 02: Kaplan-Meier estimates and plots


# Summary measures of S(t)

* Median time to event (black dashed line)
* Event rate at time $t$ (blue dashed line)
* Restricted mean survival time (RMST) to $t^*$
    * (Unrestricted) mean survival may not be well-defined
    * RMST is the average event-free time up to $t^*$
    * Equivalent to the area under S(t) from 0 to $t^*$

    - Closely tied to the Cox model
- Difference or ratio of median survival
    - Simple measure, easily understood
    - Connection to accelerated failure time models
- Difference or ratio of RMST
    - Re-emerging with treatments providing long-term cure fractions

Which one(s) you use depends on which aspects of the survival distribution are important

# Testing for differences in survival functions

$H_0: S_0(t) = S_1(t)$ vs $H_1: S_0(t) \ne S_1(t)$

- Log rank test
   - Equivalent to Mantel_Haenszel test for binary data, where stratification is at unique event times (see back-ups for more details)
   - Most powerful test when the hazard ratio is constant (but applicable even if it is not)
   - Gives relatively higher weight to later differences in S(t)

- Generalized Wilcoxan test
   - A weighted version of the log-rank test with weights proportional to the number at risk
   - Gives relatively higher weight to early differences in S(t)
   - Thus, more sensitive when differences in survival occur early


# Workbook 03: Summary measures from S(t) and comparing survival functions


# Semi-parametric models for TTE data

* Cox Proportional hazards model (the Cox model)
    - Baseline hazard is not estimated directly
* Connection to Poisson model
    - Breslow's formulation
* Piecewise exponential as a simplification
* Smooth baseline hazards
    - Provides a similar (though not identical) model with the ability to simulate



# Cox PH model

Originally proposed by Cox in 1972 @Cox1972-ul

:::{.notebox}
$$
h(t) = h_0(t) \exp(\theta_1 x_1 + \dots \theta_p x_p)
$$
Note: there is no intercept in the exponential ... <red>why?</red>
:::

$h_0(t)$ is referred to as the <red>baseline hazard</red>

* $h_0(t) > 0$ 
* The baseline hazard function is not specified
    * We'll see that it does not need to be specified in order to estimate $\theta$
* The covariate effects modify the hazard <red>proportionately</red>
    - The covariate model is linear in the parameters
    - Similar  to the linear predictor we saw in logistic regression


# Connection to survival function

Recall that 
$$
S(t) = \exp \left\{ -\int_0^t h(s) ~ ds \right\}
$$

Then, under the Cox model we have

$$
\begin{align*}
S(t) &= \exp \left\{ -\int_0^t h_0(s) \exp(\theta_1 x_1) ~ ds \right\} \\
 &= \exp \left\{ -\exp(\theta_1 x_1) ~ H_0(t) \right\} \\
 &= \left\{ S_0(t)\right\}^{\exp(\theta_1 x_1)}
\end{align*}
$$
where $S_0(t) = \exp\left\{ -H_0(t) \right\}$ is the <red>baseline survival function</red>


# Example of proportional hazards

# Parameter estimation

Cox proposed using a partial likelihood approach, treating the baseline hazard as an infinite dimensional nuisance parameter.

This yields the likelihood function (assuming unique event times):

$$
\ell(\theta | x) =  \prod_{i=1}^k \frac{\exp(x_i^T \theta)}{\sum_{j \in R(i)} \exp(x_j^T \theta)}
$$
where 

* there are $k$ unique event times
* $R(j)$ is the set of subjects at risk for an event at $t(j)$

Note that the product is only over the $k$ events, not over all subjects.


# Parameter interpretation

Suppose we have the model
$$
h(t) = h_0(t) \exp(\theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2)
$$
where $x_1$ is binary and $x_2$ is continuous.

* Then, $e^{\theta_1}$ represents the hazard ratio comparing $x_1=1$ to $x_1=0$
    - $\theta_1$ represents the log hazard ratio

* $e^{\theta_2}$ represents the hazard ratio for a one unit difference in $x_2$
    - $\exp(\theta_2 \times d)$ represents the hazard ratio for a $d$ unit difference in $x_2$


# Example model

As an example, let's fit the model:
$$
h(t) = h_0(t) \exp\left\{ \theta_1 \cdot Q_1 + \theta_2 \cdot Q_2 + \theta_3 \cdot Q_3 + \theta_4 \cdot Q_4 \right\}
$$
where the covariates $Q_1, \dots, Q_4$ are indicators for exposure quartile

$$
Q_j = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{CAVGSS in quartile } j \\
  0 & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}
$$

Questions:

* What does $h_0(t)$ correspond to?
* What does $\theta_1$ correspond to?

# Estimation of the Cox model in R

To fit the Cox model in R, we'll use the `coxph` function:

```{r}
fit1 <- coxph(Surv(TTE, AE_any) ~ Quartile, data=dat_use)
```

* Similar LHS as used with `survfit` (for K-M estimate)
* RHS can include factor or continuous variables
  - Character variables are converted to factors


# Output from `coxph`

```{r, echo=TRUE}
print(fit1)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ci = pmtables::sig(exp(confint(fit1))["QuartileQ1",])

hr1 = pmtables::sig(exp(coef(fit1))[1])

est = glue::glue("{hr1} ({paste(ci,collapse=',')})")
```

* Hazard ratio comparing Q1 to placebo: `r est`

# Estimation of the baseline cumulative hazard function from a Cox model

* Recall, estimation of covariate effects did not need an estimate of $h_0(t)$

* However, we can obtain a post-hoc estimate of $H_0(t)$ and $S_0(t)$

$$
\widehat{H_0}(t) = \sum_{j: t(j) \leq t} \frac{D_j}{\sum_{i \in R(j)} \exp(\hat{\theta}_1 x_{1i} + \dots \hat{\theta}_p x_{pi})}
$$
where 

* $t(j)$ are the ordered unique event times
* $R(j)$ is the set of subjects at risk for an event at $t(j)$
* $D_j$ is the number of events at time $t(j)

# Baseline hazard estimation: intuition

$$
\widehat{H_0}(t) = \sum_{j: t(j) \leq t} \frac{D_j}{\sum_{i \in R(j)} \exp(\hat{\theta}_1 x_{1i} + \dots \hat{\theta}_p x_{pi})}
$$

* With no covariates, this simplifies to the Nelson-Aalen estimator
* With covariates, the denominator is the counter-factual number of subjects at risk had all subjects been in the reference group

The baseline survival function is $\widehat{S_0}(t) = \exp\left\{ -\widehat{H_0}(t) \right\}$

The subject-specific survival function is
$$
\widehat{S_i}(t) = \left[ \widehat{S_0}(t) \right] ^{\exp(\hat{\theta}_1 x_{1i} + \dots + \hat{\theta}_p x_{pi})} 
$$

# Model evaluation for the Cox model

Our primary model evaluation tools will be:

* Comparing model predicted and observed survival
* Martingale and deviance residuals for functional form of covariate effects
* Assessing the PH assumption
* Concordance / Harrell's C-index


# Comparing model predicted and observed survival (1)

To extract predicted survival curves from a Cox model, we'll use the `survfit` function

```{r}
# One line per unique covariate pattern

# Martingale residuals

The Martingale residual is defined as

$$
M_i = \delta_i - \widehat{H_i}(T^*_i)
$$
where 

$$
\delta_i = \cases{1 & event \\
0 & censored}
$$
and
$T^*$ is the observed event or censoring time

:::{.notebox}

Because $H(t)$ is is expected number of events according to the model, the Martingale residual is an "observed - expected" type of residual.

:::

Often asymmetric due to the fact that $M_i \in (-\infty, 1)$

# Deviance residuals

The deviance residual is defined as

$$
D_i = \text{sign}(M_i) \sqrt{-2 \left( M_i + \delta_i \log \widehat{H_i}(T^*_i)\right) }
$$

* More symmetric than Martingale residuals
* Roughly have mean=0 and sd=1

# Uses for Martingale and Deviance residuals

# Assessing PH assumption

* Plot standardized Schoenfeld residuals vs time
    - Shows how coefficient changes with time
    - Flat line if PH model is correct
* Test for significance of including time-by-covariate interactions in the model
* Compare predicted and observed survival

# Assessing PH assumption: example

```{r}
assess_ph_fit1 <- cox.zph(fit1)

# Concordance as a measure of model fit

Concordance is a measure of how well the predicted risk of an event aligns with the observed risk.

Imagine you have two randomly selected subjects $i$ and $j$ with 

* Covariates $x_i$ and $x_j$
* Risk scores: $\eta_i = x_i^T \hat{\theta}$ and $\eta_j = x_j^T \hat{\theta}$
* (True) event times: $T_i$ and $T_j$

Then concordance (c-index) estimates: $P(T_i > T_j ~|~ \eta_i < \eta_j)$

Harrell et al. @Harrell1982-ux proposed a method for handling censored data.

A model with higher c-index should provide better predictions.

# Cox model as a Poisson regression

It turns out that we can get the same likelihood if we view the data as arising from a Poisson process with intervals defined by the unique event times. @Whitehead1980-fl

* Divide time into non-overlapping intervals with segments defined by observed event times
* Constant baseline hazard within each interval

:::{.notebox}

This yields another way of thinking about the Cox model as a data generating model.

* Data are arising from a continuous baseline hazard which we estimate with piecewise constants
* Piecewise constant hazard = piecewise exponential model

:::


# Piecewise exponential as an approximation to the Cox model

* This means that one approximation to a Cox model is
    - Piecewise exponential with predefined intervals
    - The more intervals, the closer the result is to Cox model

The model is given by 
$$h(t) = h_0(t) \exp(\theta_1 x_1 + \dots + \theta_p x_p)$$ 
where

$$
h_0(t) = \lambda_j \text{ for } t \in [\tau_{j-1} ,  \tau_j)
$$

* How to define the time intervals depends on 
    - Clinical knowledge (e.g., transplant @French2012-qv )
    - Time-varying predictors
    - Expected number and timing of events

* This formulation provides a semi-parametric model from which we can simulate survival data


# Smooth non-parametric baseline hazard functions 

* An alternative semi-parametric model is to estimate the baseline hazard using smoothing splines @Royston2002-vc

* Can be fitted using the `flexsurv` R package and in `brms`

* Royston and Parmar  @Royston2002-vc propose $g(S(t)) = s(t) + \beta^T x$

    - $s(t)$ is a smooth function modeled using cubic smoothing splines
    - $g(S) = \log( -\log(S))$ corresponds to a proportional hazards model
    - $g(S) = \log(1/S - 1)$ corresponds to a proportional odds model

* `brms` implementation uses M-splines for the baseline hazard

    - M-splines are non-negative and integrate to I-splines
    - Simplifies calculations


# Extensions to standard Cox model

* Stratified Cox model 
    - Allows different  baseline hazard by strata
    - $h(t) = \color{red}{h_{0,s}(t)} \exp(\theta_1 x_1 + \dots + \theta_p x_p)$
    - Often used in primary analysis of TTE endpoints in clinical trials (e.g., stratify by region)
* Time-varying covariates 
    - Allows for covariates to be constant over intervals defined by the data (similar to how NONMEM treats time varying covariates)
    - Doesn't allow for continuously varying covariates
    - Frequently used when conditioning on an intermediate event (e.g., Stanford heart transplant data)
    


#  Introduction to Parametric models

* The Cox model was designed to estimate effects of covariates on the time-to-event distribution.
    - With that focus, the baseline hazard isn't of much interest.
* However, in PMx modeling we are often interested in modeling the full time-to-event distribution
    * Both the baseline hazard and covariate effects

* This will be our focus for the rest of the course
    * Accelerated failure time models in R and Stan
    * General hazard models in Stan

# Traditional parametric models

Many of the commonly used models fall under the accelerated failure time framework (Wei, @Wei1992-lp)

$$
\log (T) = \mu + \theta x + \epsilon
$$

:::{.notebox}

| ***Distribution for $\epsilon$*** |  ***Distribution for T*** |
|---------------------------------- |---------------------------|
| Extreme value              | Weibull |
| Extreme value (scale=1)    | Exponential |
| Normal                     | Log-normal |
| Logistic                   | Log-logistic |

:::


But any distribution for $T$ that has support on values of $T \ge 0$ is suitable, including Gompertz, Gamma, Generalized Gamma, etc.

Nice, conceptual introductions to (parametric) TTE modeling are by Holford @Holford2013-mh  and Bradburn et al. @Bradburn2003-fg


# AFT vs PH models

* Covariate effects in AFT models are fundamentally different than in PH models
* In a PH model, a covariate scales the hazard function
    - $h(t) = h_0(t) \exp(\theta x)$
    - $S(t) = S_0(t)^{\exp(\theta x)}$
* In an AFT model, a covariate scales time
    - $\log T = \mu + \theta x + \epsilon$
    - $S(t) = S_0(ct)$, where $c = \exp(\theta x)$ is the **acceleration factor**
    - The covariate effect is on the percentiles of the distribution
    - $\frac{\text{Percentile when } x=1}{\text{Percentile when } x=0} = \frac{1}{c}$ for all percentiles

# Features of common distributions

* Exponential
  - Hazard is constant
  - One parameter
* Weibull, Gompertz, and Gamma
  - Two parameters (scale/location and shape)
  - Hazard in monotonically increasing or decreasing
* Log-logistic and log-normal
  - Two parameters (scale/location and shape)
  - Hazard is uni-modal
  - Falling, or arc (rising then falling)
* Generalized Gamma
  - Three parameters (scale/location and shape)
  - Monotonic (increasing or decreasing); arc; bathtub


# Likelihood for parametric survival models

Assuming that censoring times are independent of event times, then the individual contribution to the likelihood function is 

$$
L_i(\theta) = \begin{cases}
f(T^*_i) & \text{for } \delta_i = 1 \\
S(T^*_i) & \text{for } \delta_i = 0
\end{cases}
$$
and the likelihood function is

$$
\begin{align*}
L(\theta) &= \prod_{i=1}^n f(T^*_i)^{\delta_i} S(T^*_i)^{1-\delta_i} \\
          & = \prod_{i=1}^n h(T^*_i)^{\delta_i} S(T^*_i)
\end{align*}
$$

# Fitting parametric TTE models in R

* The `survreg()` function in the `survival` package
* The `flexsurvreg()` function in the `flexsurv` package

We generally use the `flexsurv` package because there are more distributions available

```{r}
fit_01 <- flexsurvreg(Surv(TTE_SEVERE, AE01) ~ CAVGSS, 
                      data = dat_use,
                      dist = 'weibull')
```
